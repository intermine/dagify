Dagify!!

Spaghetti in your browser.

Building useful files:
------------------------

Install dev-dependencies:

```:sh
$ npm install
```

Build everything

```:sh
$ make
```

This produces:

* `dagify.js`, the main library file
* `ontology-widget.js`,a wrapper around the library in the Report Widget interface
* `demo.js`, a demonstration web-app.
* `dist`, a directory containing all the files needed for use as a report widget.
